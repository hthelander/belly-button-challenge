# belly-button-challenge

Deployed at https://hthelander.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

In this challenge, we read in data via an API call and used it to build an interactive webpage featuring three different charts and a tag providing the metadata (id, age, race, location, etc.) for each person sampled in the data set.  Using JS, we are able to build a function that updates the page with each new choice in the dropdown function.
